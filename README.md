*An Analysis of Efficiency and Security using Automation and IaC*

**Author:** Guy Brown  
**University:** York St John University

## 📄 Project Summary
This dissertation investigates the use of Ansible to automate system administration tasks across both Linux and Windows platforms. A suite of tested Ansible playbooks was developed to manage user accounts, install web servers, apply security hardening, and perform updates. These tasks were evaluated against equivalent manual procedures to assess operational efficiency, reliability, and ethical considerations in infrastructure automation.
